            "text": "GPUArrays Documentation\n\n\nGPUArrays is an abstract interface for GPU computations. Think of it as the AbstractArray interface in Julia Base but for GPUs. It allows you to write generic julia code for all GPU platforms and implements common algorithms for the GPU. Like Julia Base, this includes BLAS wrapper, FFTs, maps, broadcasts and mapreduces. So when you inherit from GPUArrays and overload the interface correctly, you will get a lot of functionality for free. This will allow to have multiple GPUArray implementation for different purposes, while maximizing the ability to share code. Currently there are two packages implementing the interface namely \nCLArrays\n and \nCuArrays\n. As the name suggests, the first implements the interface using OpenCL and the latter uses CUDA.\n\n\n\n\nThe Abstract GPU interface\n\n\nDifferent GPU computation frameworks like CUDA and OpenCL, have different names for accessing the same hardware functionality. E.g. how to launch a GPU Kernel, how to get the thread index and so forth. GPUArrays offers a unified abstract interface for these functions. This makes it possible to write generic code that can be run on all hardware. GPUArrays itself even contains a pure \nJulia implementation\n of this interface. The julia reference implementation is a great way to debug your GPU code, since it offers more informative errors and debugging information compared to the GPU backends - which mostly silently error or give cryptic errors (so far).\n\n\nYou can use the reference implementation by using the \nGPUArrays.JLArray\n type.\n\n\nThe functions that are currently part of the interface:\n\n\nThe low level dim + idx function, with a similar naming scheme as in CUDA:\n\n\n# with * being either of x, y or z\nblockidx_*(state), blockdim_*(state), threadidx_*(state), griddim_*(state)\n# Known in OpenCL as:\nget_group_id,      get_local_size,    get_local_id,       get_num_groups\n\n\n\n\nHigher level functionality:\n\n\n#\n\n\nGPUArrays.gpu_call\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\ngpu_call(kernel::Function, A::GPUArray, args::Tuple, configuration = length(A))\n\n\n\n\nCalls function \nkernel\n on the GPU. \nA\n must be an GPUArray and will help to dispatch to the correct GPU backend and supplies queues and contexts. Calls the kernel function with \nkernel(state, args...)\n, where state is dependant on the backend and can be used for getting an index into \nA\n with \nlinear_index(state)\n. Optionally, a launch configuration can be supplied in the following way:\n\n\n1) A single integer, indicating how many work items (total number of threads) you want to launch.\n    in this case `linear_index(state)` will be a number in the range `1:configuration`\n2) Pass a tuple of integer tuples to define blocks and threads per blocks!\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nGPUArrays.linear_index\n \n \nMethod\n.\n\n\nlinear_index(state)\n\n\n\n\nlinear index corresponding to each kernel launch (in OpenCL equal to get_global_id).\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nGPUArrays.global_size\n \n \nMethod\n.\n\n\nglobal_size(state)\n\n\n\n\nGlobal size == blockdim * griddim == total number of kernel execution\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nGPUArrays.@linearidx\n \n \nMacro\n.\n\n\nlinearidx(A, statesym = :state)\n\n\n\n\nMacro form of \nlinear_index\n, which calls return when out of bounds.
