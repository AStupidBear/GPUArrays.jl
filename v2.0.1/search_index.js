Think of it as the AbstractArray interface in Julia Base but for GPUs. It allows you to write generic julia code for all GPU platforms and implements common algorithms for the GPU. Like Julia Base, this includes BLAS wrapper, FFTs, maps, broadcasts and mapreduces. So when you inherit from GPUArrays and overload the interface correctly, you will get a lot of functionality for free. This will allow to have multiple GPUArray implementation for different purposes, while maximizing the ability to share code. Currently there are two packages implementing the interface namely CLArrays and CuArrays. As the name suggests, the first implements the interface using OpenCL and the latter uses CUDA.","category":"page"},{"location":"#The-Abstract-GPU-interface-1","page":"Home","title":"The Abstract GPU interface","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Different GPU computation frameworks like CUDA and OpenCL, have different names for accessing the same hardware functionality. E.g. how to launch a GPU Kernel, how to get the thread index and so forth. GPUArrays offers a unified abstract interface for these functions. This makes it possible to write generic code that can be run on all hardware. GPUArrays itself even contains a pure Julia implementation of this interface. The julia reference implementation is a great way to debug your GPU code, since it offers more informative errors and debugging information compared to the GPU backends - which mostly silently error or give cryptic errors (so far).","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"You can use the reference implementation by using the GPUArrays.JLArray type.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The functions that are currently part of the interface:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The low level dim + idx function, with a similar naming scheme as in CUDA:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"# with * being either of x, y or z\nblockidx_*(state), blockdim_*(state), threadidx_*(state), griddim_*(state)\n# Known in OpenCL as:\nget_group_id,      get_local_size,    get_local_id,       get_num_groups","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Higher level functionality:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"gpu_call(f, A::GPUArray, args::Tuple, configuration = length(A))\n\nlinear_index(state)\n\nglobal_size(state)\n\n@linearidx(A, statesym = :state)\n\n@cartesianidx(A, statesym = :state)\n\nsynchronize_threads(state)\n\ndevice(A::AbstractArray)\n\nsynchronize(A::AbstractArray)\n\n@LocalMemory(state, T, N)","category":"page"},{"location":"#GPUArrays.gpu_call","page":"Home","title":"GPUArrays.gpu_call","text":"gpu_call(kernel::Function, A::GPUArray, args::Tuple, configuration = length(A))\n\nCalls function kernel on the GPU.
